      "Text:  Hi friends, I own shares of $AMTD. I bought early last month after the price plummeted with the commission news. Now that Charles Schwab is in the process of acquiring them, I’m a bit confused with the all-stock deal. \n",

      "Ameritrade stockholders will receive 1.0837 Schwab shares for every share held. I understand that once the deal goes through and is finalized, current shareholders will receive Schwab shares accordingly. In regard to share price, does this mean that, for example, if $SCHW closes at $50, then $AMTD’s price would in theory settle at ($50)(1.0837) = $54.19? I’m sure I’m oversimplifying and overlooking important factors, but is that how it basically works? I’m still fairly new to investing so any help/responses are greatly appreciated!\n",
